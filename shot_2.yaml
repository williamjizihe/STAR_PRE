    State: [0, 0], Region 1

    Goal: [0, 15], Region 4

    Adjacency list details the connections between regions:

    1: [2]

    2: []

    3: []

    4: []

    The top-down view of the maze is shown below, W represents walls, A represents the agent''s current position, G represents the goal. The number represents the region number:

    4 4 3 3

    G 4 3 3

    W W W 3

    1 1 2 2

    A 1 2 2

    
    Thinking Process:

    1. Identify the agent''s current region, identify the goal region

    2. Identify where is the wall.

    3. Examine the adjacency list to see which regions connect to the current region.

    4. Observe the maze to see which other regions are also connected to the current region.

    5. From these connected regions, choose the one that moves closest to the goal without hitting walls.

    Based on the above analysis, what is the most strategic next region for the agent to explore? Answer format: Region <i>.'

  content: '1. The ant''s current position (A) is in Region 1. The goal (G) is in
    Region 4.

    2. There is a wall blocking the direct path north from Region 1 to Region 4.

    3. Region 1 is directly connected to Region 2.

    4. From Region 1, moving eastward avoids the wall and provides access to Region
    2. Region 2 then connects further east to Region 3, which is adjacent to Region
    4 to the west.

    5. Since moving north directly from Region 1 to Region 4 is blocked by the wall,
    the most strategic next region for the agent to explore is Region 2. This region
    provides a clear path that circumvents the wall and facilitates access to further
    regions leading towards the goal.

    Answer: Region 2'

  2. Identify where is the wall.
  3. Examine the adjacency list to see which regions connect to the current region.
  4. Observe the maze to see which other regions are also connected to the current region.
  5. Since the agent is already in the goal region, the strategic decision would be to stay.'

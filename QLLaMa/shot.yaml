  content: '1. The ant''s current position (A) is in Region 1. The goal (G) is in
    Region 4.

    2. There is a wall blocking the direct path north from Region 1 to Region 4.

    3. Region 1 is directly connected to Region 2.

    4. From Region 1, moving eastward avoids the wall and provides access to Region
    2. Region 2 then connects further east to Region 3, which is adjacent to Region
    4 to the west.

    5. Since moving north directly from Region 1 to Region 4 is blocked by the wall,
    the most strategic next region for the agent to explore is Region 2. This region
    provides a clear path that circumvents the wall and facilitates access to further
    regions leading towards the goal.

    Answer: Region 2'

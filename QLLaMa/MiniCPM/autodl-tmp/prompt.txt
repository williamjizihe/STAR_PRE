In this task, the ant must navigate a maze to reach the exit. Act as Navigator for the ant, and select the most appropriate region from the divided areas as the ant's next target region. The matrix below shows whether the ant has moved from one region to another during the exploration.

The top-down view of the maze is shown below. In the image, red represents ant's current position, grey represents obstacles, and yellow represents the goal, the regions are divided by black lines and filled with blue color. The number represents the region number.
